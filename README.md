# Repo info
This is our default README.md file for our repos. You can get the first image from:
[https://repobeats.axiom.co/](https://repobeats.axiom.co/)

The contributors image generated here: [contrib.rocks/preview](contrib.rocks/preview)

The other images can be found here: 
[https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile](https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile)

# How to use
Copy the README.md file (This one) into the new repo and remove the very top text.

Go to [https://repobeats.axiom.co/](https://repobeats.axiom.co/) and sign in with github.

Go to the configs section and click on the plus icon

Select the owner as "proJM-Dev-team" and repo as new repo name, leave show bot activity off.

Take the image code and replace it up the top.

Change the contributors image by going to [contrib.rocks/preview](contrib.rocks/preview) and putting in the new repo.

Go to [https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile](https://github.com/alexandresanlim/Badges4-README.md-Profile) and put images wanted under using section. In our case we are using markdown for the README.md files and github because the file in profile/README.md goes on our profile

Change the Repo info and how to use as wanted.
